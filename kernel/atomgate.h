 * Atomthreads Gate library.
 *
 * This module implements a lightweight gate synchronization object to the
 * atomthreads Run Time Executive. A "gate" in this context is a binary
 * execution control mechanism that is similar to a transistor or relay
 * in electronics.  A gate can be in one of two states based on the value
 * of a control level (analogous to the control input to the transistor).
 * When the level is high, some calling threads can continue, others
 * will be blocked. Same is true when the level is low. Each time the
 * level value that controls the state of the gate object changes, all
 * threads previously blocked on it are allowed to proceed. At any one
 * time, all threads blocked on a gate object are waiting for the state
 * opposite its current state.
 *
 * The control value of the gate is restricted to two levels, low and
 * high.  Threads that call the interface to wait on a gate specify
 * a desired control level and a timeout.  If the desired control level
 * matches that of the gate object, the thread continues without blocking,
 * otherwise it is suspended and inserted into the blocking queue for
 * the gate.  When the state changes, when the "release" interface is
 * called, or when the gate object is deleted, all threads currently
 * waiting on the gate object are unblocked.  If a blocked threads
 * timeout expires, that thread is unblocked individually without
 * affecting any remaining threads blocked on the gate object.
 *
 * The gate model differs from the semaphore and mutex in several key ways.
 * Both the mutex and semaphore provide a serial control model based on
 * limiting the number of threads that may access some resource (code
 * execution, data structures, IO devices, etc.).  The gate, on the other
 * hand, is a parallel control model.  When the state of the gate changes,
 * all threads blocked on that gate are unblocked and eligible for
 * scheduling.  Typically, a gate is tied to an event (software or hardware)
 * that multiple threads are waiting for; when the event occurs, all of those
 * threads get notified at the same time.
 *
 * In its simplest form, the gate can be used as an on-off switch, where
 * all threads that pass through it desire the same control state.  Allowing
 * threads to block on either the high or low state is a small extension,
 * adding only the choice of which state to wait for and which state to
 * release.  Waiting for the high state is like a PNP transistor, electrons
 * flow when a positive (high) signal is applied to the control input.
 * Similarly, waiting for the low state is like an NPN transistor, allowing
 * flow only when the control input is low.  Using both control states at
 * once is a set of PNP and NPN transistors with the control input tied to
 * the same signal. This is also the model of a mechanical relay or switch
 * with two circuits where only one is open and one closed for each state.
 *
 * Gates do not have problems with priority inversion, since no thread may
 * own a gate, the a change affects all tasks blocked on the gate.  Since the
 * gate only permits two control states, all threads blocked are waiting for
 * whatever state the gate is not currently in.
 *
 * The following public interfaces are defined by the gate library:
 *
 *    uint8_t atomGateCreate(ATOM_GATE* gate, uint8_t level);
 *    uint8_t atomGateDelete(ATOM_GATE* gate);
 *    uint8_t atomGateWaitFor(ATOM_GATE*, uint8_t waitFor, int32_t timeout);
 *    uint8_t atomGateSetControl(ATOM_GATE* gate, uint8_t level);
 *    uint8_t atomGateRelease(ATOM_GATE* gate, uint8_t waitingFor);
 *    uint8_t atomGateGetControl(ATOM_GATE* gate, uint8_t* levelPtr);
 *
 * atomGateCreate()
 *    Initialize n gate object with a specified control level.
 *    Allocation is done by the caller.
 *
 * atomGateDelete()
 *    Unblocks all threads blocked on the gate and resets the gate control
 *    state to low.  Doesn't actually delete the gate object, as that
 *    is managed by the client software.  It's a bad practice to use
 *    a deleted gate, however doing so is the same as using a newly
 *    created gate.
 *
 * atomGateWaitFor()
 *    Conditionally suspends the calling thread on the gate when the
 *    gate is not in the desired state and the specified timeout.
 *    Timeout is supported to resume execution if the state does not
 *    change within a specified period.
 *
 * atomGateSetControl()
 *    Sets the control state of a gate.  If the state is changed, all threads
 *    blocked on the gate are unblocked.  If the state of the gate object is
 *    not changed, no threads are unblocked.
 *
 * atomGateRelease()
 *    Unblocks all threads that are waiting on the gate object if the current
 *    state does not match the requested released state without changing the
 *    state of the gate object. Can be used to release all blocked threads
 *    without regard to what state they're blocked on.  This prevents a race
 *    condition that can otherwise occur between control state changes.
 *
 * atomGateGetControl()
 *    Retrieves the control state level property of the gate object without
 *    affecting anything else.  Note that the value retrieved is only a sample
 *    and if an interrupt or scheduling preemption occurs between when the
 *    sample is taken and when that sample is evaluated by the application
 *    code, the actual state of the gate object may have changed.
 *
 * All of the public functions exposed by this library module return
 * atomthreads status values (see individual function documentation for
 * specific details), with ATOM_OK meaning success.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1) Push button activation.
 *    An application has actions that are performed when the user presses
 *    and releases a pushbutton.  The pushbutton is connected to an input
 *    that generates an interrupt when the button is released.  The
 *    application also has functions that are performed continuously
 *    whether the button is pressed or not.
 *
 *    With the gate, one or more threads that implement the push-button
 *    action wait for a high control level on the gate. The threads that
 *    implement the background (continuous) functions do not wait on the
 *    gate.  When the pushbutton is pressed, the interrupt handler sets the
 *    control state of the gate to high, unblocking the button action threads.
 *    On return from the interrupt, the RTE scheduler runs the higher priority
 *    button action threads (or uses "round robin" scheduling if at the same
 *    priority level); when the button action is completed, the action threads
 *    set the gate control level to low and then wait on the gate.  If the
 *    action thread(s) set the gate control state back to low immediately on
 *    release from the gate, a second push of the button before the action is
 *    completed will cause the action to repeat immediately, though pressing
 *    the button 3 times while the first time through the action is running
 *    will not cause the action to repeat that many times.  Setting the state
 *    of the gate at the end helps debounce the input.
 *
 *    Alternatively, the button interrupt can release the threads waiting on
 *    the gate without changing the state, relieving the action threads of the
 *    need to set the control level to low before waiting on the gate again.
 *    Additional button interrupts before the action threads are blocked again
 *    not affect the control state of the gate, so the action will not repeat
 *    until the user presses the button after the action has completed.
 *    Even in this scenario, if there are multiple foreground threads that
 *    wait on the same gate, they will not all complete and block again at the
 *    same time, and a button press between the first and last foreground
 *    threads blocking would cause a premature unblocking of a subset of the
 *    foreground action threads.  It is up to the software designer to solve
 *    this.
 *
 * 2) Service Completion
 *    An asynchronous operation is performed by a service thread that only
 *    runs while performing the operation.  A single gate can be used to
 *    start the operation and signal completion.  The requesting thread sets
 *    up the parameters for the operation, sets the control state of the gate,
 *    goes on to do other things, then waits, as before, until the state
 *    changes.  The same gate object is used by both the requesting and
 *    service threads, each blocking on the opposite control state.  This
 *    interaction between the requesting and service threads is generally
 *    wrapped up in an API layer that hides the details from the requesting
 *    thread implementation.
 *
 * 3) DMA or Interrupt driven serial IO
 *    Platform provided device drivers often provide an asynchronous transmit
 *    API that takes a buffer pointer and a byte count as arguments, sets up
 *    the operation, and returns before the IO has completed.  The driver
 *    performs the output using DMA or interrupts working out of the buffer
 *    provided by the caller.  This allows very efficient use of the compute
 *    resources of the system, but can create obscure problems when the
 *    support libraries do not use alternate buffers.  The POSIX conforming
 *    libraries provided by most vendors use a single per-thread, per-stream
 *    buffer for "*printf()" operations, and start at the beginning of the
 *    buffer after each call to the underlying "write()" or "write_r"
 *    function.  If that underlying function returns before the output has
 *    completed, the library will overwrite part of the buffer possibly
 *    before the bytes from that part of the buffer have been transferred
 *    to the output device, causing the data seen on the serial line to be
 *    corrupted.  Using the driver APIs that do not return until the
 *    transmit is complete generally will consume processor resources polling
 *    the output device, thus are not efficent in a multi-threaded system.
 *
 *    The original implementation of the gate for atomthreads was created to
 *    solve this problem.  The function that makes the call to the device
 *    driver sets the state of a gate, calls the driver, then waits for the
 *    state of the gate to change back before returning to the caller
 *    (in this case, the "printf()" primitive functions in "newlib").
 *    A transmit complete interrupt callback function changes the state of
 *    the gate object, thus releasing the thread.
 *
 *    The thread cannot overlap execution with the output, but the thread
 *    is blocking on the gate and consuming no CPU cycles until the
 *    transmit-done callback is invoked from the driver's interrupt handler.
 *
 *    That original version of the gate was called "event", and was later
 *    generalized into the "gate" construct implementation.
 *
 * Acknowledgments:
 *  * The source for this module was started using a copy of the code in
 *    the file file "atommutex.c", written as part of the atomthreads
 *    distribution by Kelvin Lawson.  Though much of the code is substantially
 *    different, some of the code is still just a minor modification of the
 *    original.
